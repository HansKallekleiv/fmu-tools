For FMU users
--------------

The stable release is distributed for all Equinor users through
``/project/res``. Eventually it will be distribued through Komodo,
with access to stable, testing and bleeding versions.

As of August 2018, you need to enable komodo testing prior to running
fmu-ensemble code.
